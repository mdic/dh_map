## Context
What this [map is](https://maphub.net/Cen4infoRes/russian-ukraine-monitor):
- Data on social media (especially from twitter and you tube) 
- Map that reports events happening in Ukraine 

Rather than placing the different points one by one, we will use data to automatically points them. 
For this we will use data with geographical position from twitter  

The data will then be imported into uMap: (similar to google maps, but more open source) you can create maps, also once the link is shared others can modify the map)
There is a set of tools on the right part: 
- options to provide the details (name, description, change the aspect of the map) 
- we will focus to import the data which will automatically be charged on the map 

## How do we convert the data from twitter into data the map understands? 

Github > UMap - Documentation > import the data > data format  

From [uMap documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/UMap/Guide):
All these formats: geojosn, gpx, kml etc…are used whenever it comes to create maps (digital geography).
CSV > is used as excel file, a table where each field is separated by a character like a comma or a semicolon, so data are converted in a proper table.  
Our purpose is to import CVS file into uMap  

## Data from twitter: how to collect them? 

Select one by one OR collect them all automatically through a software called [twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint) or [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape). We will use the latter because it allows us to get data with geolocalization while twint doesn’t.  
G-location is essential for the construction of our map 

Snscrape requires Python, and can be used like so:
`snscrape twitter-user textfiles` gives us the data from the account `textfiles`

Data can be saved in JSONL using the `--jsonl` argument, and saved to a file using the `>` character:
`snscrape -- jsonl twitter-user textfiles > text_twitter`

the software is basically saving each tweet. We have the link to the tweet, the field, the content, another copy of the content, the username, the ID and lots of other data. 

To scrape tweets posted from a specific location, we need the help of Coordinates Converter to get the latitude and longitude values. Get the coordinates (starting point from the collection of the data) we copy the coordinate [from the selected point on the map](https://coordinates-converter.com/en/decimal/50.233152,36.166992?karte=OpenStreetMap&zoom=5)

Once we have our coordinates, how do we ask snscrape to collect data? [This article provides with some hints](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-scrape-tweets-by-location-in-python-using-snscrape-8c870fa6ec25)

So we will need the coordinates and the radial area (km) of interest around the point  

## How to integrate the tool and which elements we will include inside the map?
First, we run a test by collecting top 20 tweets that are glocated using the syntax
`snscrape –jsonl—max-result 20 twitter-search geocode: (coordinates) (radial area km)`

Results are saved in jsonl, meaning that every line is a Json object, where an **object** is a pair composed of two elements, a **key** and its **value**. E.g. the URL of the tweet is the ‘description of the element’ and ‘the value of the key’ which is the content. Key-value pairs are separated by a comma.  

Details pertaining to the user who tweeted are stored inside an object, containing i.a.:
- `id`: unique number which identifies the user
- `username`
- `display name`
- `description`
- `created`
- `followerCount`
- `friendsCount`

etc 

Another object describes the coordinates using `latitude`, `longitude`, and `place`, where the latter is the name of the place.  
We can find another box which contains information about the place 
We therefore start working with the coordinates  

`snscrape –jsonl—max-result 300 twitter-search geocode: (coordinates) (radius km)`

## How do we go from snscrape view to an excel table?  
We use a python [script](scripts/01_import-jsonl.py) to do this, and we subsequently import the resulting csv into uMap
