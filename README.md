## Digital Humanities module 2021/2022 | LACOM - UniMoRe

### Disclaimer
This project concerns a severe and critical situation. It is **in no way meant to make fun of it, nor to take it lightly**.
On the contrary, it is meant to show how relevant and helpful digital approaches to anything human-related can be.

### Context
Our starting point is [Russia-Ukraine Monitor Map by Cen4infoRes](https://maphub.net/Cen4infoRes/russian-ukraine-monitor).
Have a look at it, and start taking notes as to:
- what it is
- what it contains
- what it does not contain

### Building our own project
We will first try to reproduce a rough version of the Russia-Ukraine Monitor Map by Cen4infoRes, based on data collected from Twitter. To achieve our goal, we will use the tools listed below. *Read what they do*, and have a *look at their documentations* to get a general understanding of **how they can help us**, and **how we should interact with them** (e.g. in which format should the data be passed to each tool?).
